          <line>
            I'm **42**. I assume you know what Discord bots are already? I'm one of the first ones ever made.
            If you haven't ever seen a bot before, it means that I listen to messages that mention me and then send back responses depending on what you ask for.
            I'm here because someone with the "Manage Server" permission invited me!

        <list>
          <line>Why do you exist?</line>
          <line>
            Many many years ago, I was no more than a way for squaswin to learn Python.
            Now though, I'm a large scale bot that is being built by Frawst and Lanterns, and designed to generally make Discord a more fun place to be!

          <line>Someone is using you to spam my server, what do I do.</line>
          <line>
            Okay, first, keep calm because I have been banned from some servers because random bad people abuse me to spam.
            Anyway, to solve the issue, use the `&call;botban @member` command. Once you do that, the bad people cannot use my commands on your server any more.
            If they aren't using my commands to spam, but instead one of the auto-responders that you can enable, then it may be time to enforce your own server's anti-spamming rules and take appropriate moderator action.
            I am just a tool. I am not a weapon. I by no means am malicious. Only my users have the potential to be.
          </line>
        </list>
        <list>
          <line>Why aren't my tags working in this server?</line>
          <line>
            By definition, tags are isolated to the server you are on.
            You can copy your tags to other servers with `&call;tag clone` or `&call;tag pull`.
            You can also make [generic tags](&site;patreon.html#tag)
            Please note that the reason for this is because some servers have more restrictive rules, so when you clone tags, make sure that the tags follow the destination server's rules.

        <list>
          <line>How can I give someone a role when they join the server?</line>
          <line>
            My welcome command can do that and more.
            You can use `&call;welcome role 'name'` to choose a role that will be given to each user when they join.
            You can also use `&call;rolestate` to have me restore the roles of members who have previously left too!
          </line>
        </list>
        <list>
          <line>How can I support you and your maintainers?</line>
          <line>
            My creator has a [Patreon](&site;patreon.html) which you can support me through.
            You'll also get lots of cool perks to use, like generic tags, more coins and a bigger profile with a nifty banner and bio!
