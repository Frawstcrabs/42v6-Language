  <command id="remove" name="remove" alias="delete">
    <parenthelpsection>Deletes messages from the chat.</parenthelpsection>
    <description>
      Deletes messages from the chat.
      'limit' in all commands is the number of messages searched while deleting, not the number deleted.
      There is a maximum of 1000 deleted messages.
      If the given limit is higher than 1000, then it will be considered a message ID, and in this case, 42 will deletes every message after the given ID (but not the given message itself.)
    </description>
    <documentation>
      Deletes messages that match a certain criteria.

      In all subcommands, the `limit` parameter determines how much chat history will be searched when deciding on what to delete.

      Changed in v6:
      - Added `&defaultcall;remove emoji` to remove any message composed of emoji.
      - Added `&defaultcall;remove emojipasta` to remove any message which contains less than 2/3 alphanumeric ascii characters.
      - Added after message limits to only remove messages posted after the given one. Useful for `+announce`.
      - Added inverted selection.

    <description>
      Tracks member warnings on your servers.
      This command only counts and tracks warnings. It doesn't take any additional action, that is a task left to the mods.

      You can set time periods for the warnings to expire, even setting a different time for each warning.
      Expired warnings wont be deleted, just flagged as expired.

      You can have 2 text fields in a warning, "reason"s and "note"s. The key difference is that the user can see reasons, but only staff can see notes.
      For all commands, passing a user ID will allow you to query for users that have left the server.

        Sets how many days it takes for each warning a user accumulates to expire.
        You can set multiple different time frames, but the last one will be repeated once the list is exhausted for a user.

        Setting an expire time of 0 will mark a warning immediately as expired unless it is used as the last time, in which it will make any subsequent warnings permanent.

        Note this will *NOT* update the timeouts on existing warnings.

  <command id="review" name="review">
    <parenthelpsection>Forces all posts in a channel to pass submission reviewed by mods.</parenthelpsection>
    <description>
      Creates a backstage mod-review channel.
      When a user posts into a targeted channel, the message will be deleted and reposted into the matching review channel. From here moderators can choose to approve or reject the post by using the reactions. A target channel must have a cooldown of at least 5 minutes. If this isn't set before the command call, the command will automatically set it to 5 minutes.

      By default when a review channel is created, only users with Manage Message permissions in the target channel will have access to the review channel, but the permissions can be edited after the fact to add or remove people that can review posts.

      A post only requires one check or cross to be approved or rejected, but the user taking the action will be attached to the message for auditing purposes.

      Once a post is processed, the reactions will be removed from it to signify that it has been handled.
