  <command id="sync" name="sync">
    <parenthelpsection args="['seconds'] ['content']">Runs a live countdown timer</parenthelpsection>
    <description>
      Makes me start a countdown from a given value.

      If the starting value is very high, I may accidentally lose track and stop part way.
      Any content at the end of the command will be recalled once the timer is up.
    </description>
    <helpsection args="['seconds'] ['message/mentions']">Starts a new sync timer.</helpsection>
    <documentation>
      Start a live countdown in chat for up to 1 hour (3600 seconds) and post the given message when it is done.
      You can add pings to the message to make it act like a short time remind/countdown command. This message will only actually process as a mention if the timer is longer than 5 minutes, otherwise the message content is edited into the initial message.

      As the timer nears 0, it will update quicker. This is to conserve on ratelimit as 42 can only make so many requests in a short period.

      New in v6:
       - Can use timers up to 1 hour now.
       - Can supply a message to send at the end of the timer.

    <description>
      Fetches the names matching a given discriminator.

      This command is to assist non-Nitro members to randomise their discriminator for example to avoid a stalker.
      By changing your username to one where your discriminator is taken, discord randomises your discriminator.
      This can only be done very infrequently.
