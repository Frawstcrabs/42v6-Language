  <command id="giveme" name="giveme">
    <parenthelpsection>
      Allows users to give themselves roles.
    </parenthelpsection>
    <description>
      Allows user to give themselves pre-defined roles.
      These roles can be restricted to certain conditions e.g. users can only get a giveme role if they also have some other role.
      Calling the command after a user has obtained the giveme role will remove it.
    </description>
    <documentation>
      Givemes are set roles that users can give themselves, which they can have an unlimited number of.

      Admins may add certain restrictions to givemes, namely:
      - Required roles
      - Ignored roles
      - Time delay
      Requires roles are ones which the user must have in order to obtain the giveme.
      Ignored roles are ones which the user cannot have in order to obtain the giveme.
      The time limit defines how many days the users must be on the guild for in order to obtain the giveme.

      The role of the giveme itself is allowed as a required/ignored role.
      Setting the giveme role as required means that users may only remove the giveme, not obtain it.
      Setting it as ignored means that users may obtain it but cannot remove it.

      <description>
        Creates a new giveme.
        The new giveme can be modified afterwards with commands like `&call;giveme require`, `&call;giveme time`, etc.
        These settings can also be added during creation, like so:
        `&call;giveme create name role1 require role2 require role3 ignore role4 ignore role5 time 3d`
        This will create a giveme for role1 under name, which requires that users have role2 and role3, do not have role4 and role5, and have been on the server for at least 3 days.
