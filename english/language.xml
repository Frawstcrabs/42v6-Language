    A utility bot designed by squaswin and built with help from Frawst.
    All commands are called with &defaultcall;, a custom invoker specified in `&defaultcall;alias`, or by mentioning me.
    If you need clarification or additional help, you can find extra details by clicking on the command name at the top of the embed.
    Or you could join my support server where the community is happy to help.
