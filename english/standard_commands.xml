    <documentation>
      This is 42's in-Discord help command. It can be used to get a comprehensive list of *almost* all of her commands.
      It can also be used to get detailed help on a particular topic as well as link back to this site.

      Changed in v6:
      - `&defaultcall;help search` was removed for being useless.
      - `&defaultcall;help 'cmd' 'subcmd' ...` added for detailed help on a subcommand.
      - New embed pager created for long command help outputs, no more &defaultcall;tagconfig command.
      - Removed category help, for now...

      Makes me send a hello message and respond with the time that message took to process.

      Changed in v6:
      - Now functions as a ping command.

    <documentation>
      Adds/removes different invokers (e.g. "&defaultcall;") for my commands in a guild,
      allowing me to resolve any conflicts with other bots.

      Changed in v6:
      - The &defaultcall; invoker can now be disabled.
      - Commands can now be invoked by mentioning me. (This cannot be disabled)
      - Invokers can contain spaces and be up to 64 characters long. (long enough to have "Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch" as an invoker.)
      - You can set up to 5 custom invokers, as well as &defaultcall; and mentions!

      - Basically nothing.

    </description>
    <helpsection>Lists the botbans on the server</helpsection>
    <helpsection args="'@member'">Botbans or un-botbans the member described by @member</helpsection>

    <documentation>
      Botbans or un-botbans a member to prevent them from being able to use any commands.
      Note: This only prevents command usage, it does not stop members from interacting with 42 completely.
      They will still be picked up by autoresponses, modlog posts and other background tasks.

      Changed in v6:
      - Merged &defaultcall;botban and &defaultcall;botunban into a single command.
      - Added ability to list guild bans
    </documentation>

  <command id="toggle" name="toggle" alias="disable">
    <parenthelpsection>Toggles commands and subcommands.</parenthelpsection>
    <description>
      Disables or enables commands or subcommands.
      You can specify subcommands by separating the command path with a dot (.)
      For example `&call;toggle tag.create` will disable the &call;tag create subcommand.

      You can select multiple elements by using an asterisk (\*)
      For example `&call;toggle tag.*` will disable all subcommands of tag, but not &call;tag itself.

      You can specify multiple elements at once, and they will be toggled in order
      For example `&call;toggle tag.* tag.create tag.edit` will disable every subcommand of tag except create and edit.

      If a command is disabled, all its subcommands will also be disabled.
      Members with the bot-mod permission can use disabled commands.
    </description>
    <helpsection args="'path' ...">Toggles, in order, the given paths.</helpsection>
    <documentation>
      Disables or enables commands and subcommands.

      The toggle command takes a list of "command path" objects, which are basically just commands, except instead of the subcommand names being separated by spaces, they're separated by dots.
      For example, the command `&defaultcall;tag create` can be toggled with the path `tag.create`

      You can also use wildcards in command paths in order to affect every matching subcommand.
      for example, the path `tag.*` will affect every subcommand of tag *without* affecting `&defaultcall;tag` itself.
      Using a path of a single `*` will affect every command in 42. Useful for turning everything back on again.

      If a command has been disabled, all its subcommands are also inaccessible.
      Users with bot-mod permissions can use disabled commands.

      Changed in v6:
      - No more command categories :(
      - Can toggle subcommands instead though :)
      - Explicit enable and disable commands to skip out the guessing.
      - Revamped list command shows you what's disabled. You can even search it too.
    </documentation>

    <output>
      <line id="TOGGLE_PATH_error">
        The path you gave me was not one for a valid command.
